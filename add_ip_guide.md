# üè† Adding Home/Remote Access

## Quick Steps to Add Your Home IP:

### 1. Get Your Home IP Address
When you reach home, visit: https://whatismyipaddress.com
Copy the IP address shown.

### 2. Update the Code
Replace `YOUR_HOME_IP_HERE` in `app.py` with your actual home IP:

```python
ALLOWED_IPS = [
    "192.168.0.",           # Local network range  
    "203.123.45.67",        # Office IP (example)
    "198.87.65.43",         # Home IP (example)
    "127.0.0.1",            # Localhost
]
```

### 3. Redeploy
Push the updated code to GitHub and Streamlit will auto-update.

## Adding Multiple Locations:

```python
ALLOWED_IPS = [
    "192.168.0.",           # Local network
    "203.123.45.67",        # Office IP
    "198.87.65.43",         # Your home IP
    "156.78.90.12",         # Receptionist home IP
    "145.67.89.23",         # Another authorized location
    "127.0.0.1",            # Localhost
]
```

## Dynamic IP Handling:
If your home IP changes frequently, you can:
1. Use IP range: `"198.87.65."` (allows 198.87.65.1-255)
2. Add multiple IPs for the same location
3. Update the list when IP changes

## Security Benefits:
‚úÖ Only authorized locations can access
‚úÖ Prevents unauthorized access from anywhere else
‚úÖ You control exactly who can access from where
‚úÖ Easy to add/remove locations

Just send me your home IP when you get it, and I'll update the code!
